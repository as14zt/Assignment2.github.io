			one of 2 paragraphs required. The tag for this paragraph will be bold.The purpose of a paragraph is to express a speaker’s thoughts on a particular point in a clear way that is unique and specific to that paragraph. In other words, paragraphs shouldn’t be mixing thoughts or ideas. When a new idea is introduced, generally, a writer will introduce a new paragraph.
			I’ve been an on-and-off aspiring writer for years. The only thing I’ve actually published is a collection of short stories that I wrote in 2010 as a Christmas gift to my girlfriend (long story). On my computer hard drive is one half-finished manuscript that is a year or so older than that and a dozen or so ‘ideas’ for novels that are even older still.
	Like many aspiring novelists, I have become adept at coming up with endless reasons why I can’t get back to writing “right now”, while at the same keeping the dream alive that “one day” I’ll not only finish, but become a highly successful author, to boot. You’ve heard this story before.
	Flash back to June, 2015.</p> My girlfriend (yes, the recipient of the aforementioned short story collection)
	 <p>tells me about a jarringly vivid dream she just had. She described it as though she were watching a movie. The plot was captivating, thrilling, timely and controversial. I was inspired. “That would make a great novel,” I said, “You give me the basic outline and I’ll write it!” She was excited by the prospect and agreed. We had a deal.
	Flash forward three months: all I have to show for my efforts is an anemic first chapter, a handful of scattered notes and a frustrated girlfriend, who is starting to lose her enthusiasm for the project. My excuses for procrastinating haven’t changed in all these years: I’m swamped at work; I need to do a bunch of research first; I have to go to the gym; The Walking Dead is on tonight; etc., etc.This is some awesome text for my first assignment in STAC1P02.
